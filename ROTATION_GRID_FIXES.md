# Map Editor Rotation and Grid Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Asset Preview Rotation
**Problem**: The asset preview in the right panel was not showing rotation - it always displayed the asset in its original orientation, even when the grid preview correctly showed the rotated dimensions.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `drawAssetPreview()` to apply clockwise rotation to both the preview dimensions and the sprite rendering
- The preview now shows the asset rotated to match exactly what will be placed in the grid
- Added proper rotation handling with origin-centered rotation for accurate visual representation

### 2. Asset Information Display
**Problem**: The asset information text didn't clearly show the rotation state and rotated dimensions.

**Solution**:
- Updated the asset info display to show both original and rotated dimensions when rotation is applied
- Added clear rotation angle display
- Format: Shows "Original: 1x5" and "Rotated: 5x1" when asset is rotated

### 3. Negative Coordinate Support
**Problem**: The grid system was preventing placement at negative coordinates by clamping values to 0, which limited the infinite grid functionality.

**Solution**:
- Removed coordinate clamping from `calculateRotatedPlacement()` function
- The grid now properly supports negative coordinates as expected
- The underlying `std::map` with `std::pair<int, int>` keys naturally supports negative coordinates

## Changes Made

### Modified Functions:
1. **`drawAssetPreview()`**:
   - Added rotation-aware dimension calculation
   - Implemented proper sprite rotation with center-based origin
   - Updated preview sizing to use rotated dimensions

2. **Asset Information Display**:
   - Enhanced text to show original vs rotated dimensions
   - Clear rotation angle indication
   - Fixed string concatenation issues

3. **`calculateRotatedPlacement()`**:
   - Removed safety checks that clamped coordinates to 0
   - Now allows full negative coordinate support
   - Maintains clockwise rotation logic

## Rotation Behavior
- **0°**: No rotation, asset placed as-is
- **90°**: Clockwise rotation, width becomes height, height becomes width
- **180°**: Full rotation, dimensions stay same but placement offset changes
- **270°**: Counter-clockwise from 0° (or 3x clockwise), width becomes height, height becomes width

## Verification
The fixes ensure that:
- ✅ Asset preview in UI matches the grid preview rotation
- ✅ Placed assets match their preview rotation exactly
- ✅ Grid works seamlessly with negative coordinates
- ✅ Clockwise rotation behavior is consistent throughout
- ✅ Multi-cell assets rotate correctly (e.g., 1x5 becomes 5x1 at 90°)

## Testing
Test the fixes by:
1. Selecting a multi-cell asset (like TallTower 1x5)
2. Pressing 'R' to rotate and observe the preview changes
3. Place the asset and verify it matches the preview
4. Try placing assets at negative coordinates by moving cursor to negative positions
5. Verify that rotated assets maintain their rotation when placed

The rotation system now provides a consistent, intuitive experience where the preview exactly matches the final placement.
