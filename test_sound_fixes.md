# Sound System Fixes Test Guide

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Menu sounds ignore sound enabled setting**: All menu navigation and confirm sounds now respect the sound_enabled setting
2. **Background music doesn't restart when sound is re-enabled**: Background music now properly restarts when toggling sound back on
3. **ðŸ†• BACK/CANCEL actions (C key) missing sounds**: All back/cancel actions now have sound effects

## Scenes Fixed:
âœ… **Main Menu** (scene_menu.cpp) - UP/DOWN/SELECT sounds added
âœ… **Options Menu** (scene_options.cpp) - UP/DOWN/SELECT/QUIT(C) sounds added  
âœ… **Sound Settings** (scene_sound_settings.cpp) - UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/CONFIRM/BACK(C)/CANCEL(C) sounds added
âœ… **Screen/Viewport Config** (scene_viewport_config.cpp) - UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/CONFIRM/BACK(C)/CANCEL(C) sounds added
âœ… **Save/Load Menu** (scene_save_load.cpp) - UP/DOWN/SELECT/BACK(C) sounds added
âœ… **Battle Scene** (scene_battle.cpp) - Menu navigation, target selection, and BACK(C) sounds added

## Sound Types:
- **Navigation sounds** (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT): `menu_select` at 60.0f base volume
- **Confirm sounds** (SELECT/CONFIRM): `menu_confirm` at 80.0f base volume  
- **ðŸ†• Back sounds** (BACK/CANCEL/QUIT): `menu_select` at 50.0f base volume (slightly quieter)

## Test Steps:

### Test 1: Menu Sounds Respect Sound Setting
1. Set `sound_enabled=0` in `metadata/sound_config.txt` 
2. Run the game: `./build/release/GameEngine`
3. Navigate through ALL menus using UP/DOWN arrows, SELECT, and **C key (BACK)**:
   - Main Menu
   - Options Menu (test C key to go back)
   - Sound Settings (test C key to cancel)
   - Screen Settings (test C key to cancel)
   - Save/Load Menu (test C key to go back)
   - Battle Scene (if accessible - test C key in target selection)
4. **Expected**: No menu sounds should play in any scene, including back actions
5. Go to Options > Sound Settings
6. Change "Sound Enabled" to ON and select "Apply Changes"
7. Navigate through all menus again, including using C key
8. **Expected**: All sounds should now play with proper volume, including back sounds

### Test 2: Background Music Restart
1. With sound enabled, background music should be playing
2. Go to Options > Sound Settings
3. Change "Sound Enabled" to OFF and select "Apply Changes"
4. **Expected**: Background music stops
5. Change "Sound Enabled" back to ON and select "Apply Changes"
6. **Expected**: Background music should restart immediately

### Test 3: Volume Scaling
1. With sound enabled, go to Sound Settings
2. Adjust Master Volume and Effects Volume
3. Select "Apply Changes"
4. Navigate through menus using all controls (UP/DOWN/SELECT/C)
5. **Expected**: All menu sounds should reflect the combined Master Ã— Effects volume

### Test 4: All Menu Scenes with Back Actions
Test navigation sounds in each scene, **especially the C key**:
- **Main Menu**: UP/DOWN navigation, SELECT confirm (no back action - root menu)
- **Options Menu**: UP/DOWN navigation, SELECT confirm, **C key (QUIT) back sound**
- **Sound Settings**: UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT navigation, CONFIRM for actions, **C key (BACK/CANCEL) back sound**
- **Screen Settings**: UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT navigation, CONFIRM for actions, **C key (BACK/CANCEL) back sound**
- **Save/Load**: UP/DOWN navigation, SELECT confirm, **C key (BACK) back sound**
- **Battle Scene**: UP/DOWN for action menu, UP/DOWN for target selection, SELECT/CONFIRM, **C key (BACK) back sound in target selection**

### Test 5: Back Sound Volume Differentiation
1. Navigate through menus and notice:
   - Navigation sounds (UP/DOWN): Normal volume (60.0f base)
   - Confirm sounds (SELECT): Louder volume (80.0f base)
   - **ðŸ†• Back sounds (C key): Slightly quieter volume (50.0f base)**
2. **Expected**: Back sounds should be distinguishable but not jarring

## Technical Changes Made:

### All Menu Scenes:
- Added `m_game->isSoundEnabled()` check before playing sounds
- Added proper volume calculation: `m_game->getMasterVolume() * m_game->getEffectsVolume() * baseVolume`
- **ðŸ†• Added back sounds with 50.0f base volume for BACK/CANCEL/QUIT actions**

### Sound Volume Hierarchy:
```cpp
// Navigation sounds (60.0f base volume)
float volume = m_game->getMasterVolume() * m_game->getEffectsVolume() * 60.0f;
globalSound->playSound("menu_select", volume);

// Confirm sounds (80.0f base volume)  
float volume = m_game->getMasterVolume() * m_game->getEffectsVolume() * 80.0f;
globalSound->playSound("menu_confirm", volume);

// ðŸ†• Back sounds (50.0f base volume - slightly quieter)
float volume = m_game->getMasterVolume() * m_game->getEffectsVolume() * 50.0f;
globalSound->playSound("menu_select", volume);
```

### Sound Settings Scene (scene_sound_settings.cpp):
- Modified `applySoundSettings()` to always stop current music first
- Added logic to restart background music when sound is re-enabled
- Added call to `m_game->updateSoundSettings()` to sync with game engine

### Battle Scene (scene_battle.cpp):
- Fixed action handling to use `action.getName()` instead of `action.getType()`
- Added sounds to both menu navigation and target selection
- **ðŸ†• Added back sound for target selection cancellation**

### Game Engine (game_engine.hpp, game_engine.cpp):
- Added `updateSoundSettings()` method to sync settings between scenes and engine
- Proper sound state management

## Current Configuration:
- Sound is currently set to ON for normal use
- All menu scenes now have consistent sound behavior including back actions
- Sound effects respect the global sound enabled setting
- **ðŸ†• Back actions (C key) now provide audio feedback**

## Summary:
ðŸŽ‰ **Complete menu sound system with back action support!**
- 6 scenes updated with proper sound handling
- **ðŸ†• All BACK/CANCEL actions (C key) now have sound effects**
- Sound effects respect the sound enabled setting
- Background music properly restarts when re-enabled
- Consistent volume scaling across all menus
- **Three-tier volume system: Navigation (60) < Back (50) < Confirm (80)**
