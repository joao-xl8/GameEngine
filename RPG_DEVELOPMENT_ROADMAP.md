## 🛠 **Implementation Priority Guide**

### **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

1. **Create RPG Components**
   ```bash
   # Add the new component files to your project
   cp RPG_COMPONENTS.hpp src/
   cp RPG_SKILLS_ITEMS.hpp src/
   ```

2. **Modify Existing Components**
   ```cpp
   // In components.hpp, replace CSound with enhanced version
   // Add includes for RPG components
   #include "RPG_COMPONENTS.hpp"
   #include "RPG_SKILLS_ITEMS.hpp"
   ```

3. **Create Scene_Battle**
   ```cpp
   // Create src/scene_battle.hpp and src/scene_battle.cpp
   // Start with basic turn-based structure
   ```

### **Week 1-2 Implementation Tasks**

#### 1. Basic Battle Scene Structure
```cpp
// src/scene_battle.hpp
class Scene_Battle : public Scene {
private:
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Entity>> m_playerParty;
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Entity>> m_enemyParty;
    BattleState m_battleState = BattleState::BATTLE_START;
    
public:
    Scene_Battle(GameEngine* game, const std::vector<std::string>& enemyTypes);
    void update() override;
    void sInput() override;
    void sBattleLogic();
    void sRender() override;
};
```

#### 2. Enhanced Character Component
```cpp
// Replace existing character creation with:
auto character = std::make_shared<Entity>("Player");
auto charComp = std::make_shared<CCharacter>("Hero", CharacterType::PLAYER);
charComp->maxHP = 100;
charComp->currentHP = 100;
charComp->attack = 15;
charComp->defense = 10;
// Set elemental affinities
charComp->elementalAffinities[ElementType::FIRE] = 0;    // Normal
charComp->elementalAffinities[ElementType::ICE] = -1;    // Resist
charComp->elementalAffinities[ElementType::LIGHTNING] = -2; // Weak
character->addComponent<CCharacter>(charComp);
```

#### 3. Basic Battle Flow
```cpp
void Scene_Battle::sBattleLogic() {
    switch (m_battleState) {
        case BattleState::BATTLE_START:
            initializeBattle();
            m_battleState = BattleState::PLAYER_TURN;
            break;
            
        case BattleState::PLAYER_TURN:
            processPlayerTurn();
            break;
            
        case BattleState::ENEMY_TURN:
            processEnemyTurn();
            break;
            
        case BattleState::BATTLE_END:
            endBattle();
            break;
    }
}
```

### **Testing Strategy**

#### Unit Tests for Core Systems
```cpp
// Test elemental damage calculation
void testElementalDamage() {
    int baseDamage = 50;
    ElementType fireAttack = ElementType::FIRE;
    std::map<ElementType, int> affinities;
    affinities[ElementType::FIRE] = -2; // Weak to fire
    
    int damage = ElementalSystem::calculateElementalDamage(baseDamage, fireAttack, affinities);
    assert(damage == 100); // Should be double damage
}

// Test turn order calculation
void testTurnOrder() {
    // Create test characters with different speeds
    // Verify turn order is calculated correctly
}
```

#### Integration Tests
```cpp
// Test complete battle flow
void testBattleFlow() {
    // Create battle scene with test data
    // Simulate player actions
    // Verify battle state transitions
    // Check victory/defeat conditions
}
```

## 📊 **Content Creation Guidelines**

### **Character Design Template**
```cpp
// Example: Fire Mage character
auto fireMage = std::make_shared<CCharacter>("Pyra", CharacterType::PLAYER);
fireMage->maxHP = 80;
fireMage->maxMP = 120;
fireMage->attack = 8;
fireMage->magicAttack = 18;
fireMage->defense = 6;
fireMage->speed = 12;

// Elemental affinities
fireMage->elementalAffinities[ElementType::FIRE] = 1;      // Strong
fireMage->elementalAffinities[ElementType::ICE] = -2;      // Weak
fireMage->elementalAffinities[ElementType::LIGHTNING] = 0; // Normal

// Starting skills
auto fireball = SkillDatabase::getInstance().getSkill("fireball");
auto heal = SkillDatabase::getInstance().getSkill("heal");
fireMage->knownSkills.push_back(fireball);
fireMage->knownSkills.push_back(heal);
```

### **Enemy Design Template**
```cpp
// Example: Ice Elemental enemy
auto iceElemental = std::make_shared<CCharacter>("Ice Elemental", CharacterType::ENEMY);
iceElemental->level = 5;
iceElemental->maxHP = 120;
iceElemental->maxMP = 60;
iceElemental->attack = 12;
iceElemental->magicAttack = 16;

// Elemental affinities (opposite of fire mage)
iceElemental->elementalAffinities[ElementType::ICE] = 2;       // Absorb
iceElemental->elementalAffinities[ElementType::FIRE] = -2;    // Weak
iceElemental->elementalAffinities[ElementType::PHYSICAL] = -1; // Resist

// Enemy skills
auto iceSpike = SkillDatabase::getInstance().getSkill("ice_spike");
auto freeze = SkillDatabase::getInstance().getSkill("freeze");
iceElemental->knownSkills.push_back(iceSpike);
iceElemental->knownSkills.push_back(freeze);
```

### **Skill Design Guidelines**

#### Offensive Skills
- **Physical**: High damage, no elemental weakness
- **Fire**: Good damage, weak against ice enemies
- **Ice**: Moderate damage, chance to freeze
- **Lightning**: Fast, hits multiple targets
- **Earth**: Heavy damage, slow casting
- **Wind**: Light damage, high accuracy
- **Light**: Effective against dark enemies, can heal
- **Dark**: Drains HP/MP, causes status effects

#### Support Skills
- **Healing**: Restore HP, cure status effects
- **Buffs**: Increase stats temporarily
- **Debuffs**: Decrease enemy stats
- **Utility**: Escape, analyze enemy, etc.

This roadmap provides a clear path from your current engine to a complete FF-style RPG. The key is to build incrementally, testing each system thoroughly before moving to the next phase.

Start with the battle system foundation - it's the heart of your game and will inform all other design decisions. Once you have satisfying combat, everything else will fall into place! 🎮⚔️✨
