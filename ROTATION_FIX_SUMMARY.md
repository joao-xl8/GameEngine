# Map Editor Rotation Placement Fix

## Issue
When placing a 1x5 vertical asset (like TallTower) with rotation in the map editor, it was not being placed horizontally as expected in certain edge cases.

## Root Cause
The rotation placement calculation could result in negative coordinates when the cursor was too close to the origin, particularly for the 90° rotation case:

- **TallTower (1x5) at 90° rotation**: 
  - Formula: `placement.x = cursorX - (height - 1) = cursorX - 4`
  - If cursor at (2,2): placement.x = 2 - 4 = -2 (negative!)
  - This could cause placement failures or unexpected behavior

## Fix Applied
Added safety checks to the `calculateRotatedPlacement` function to prevent negative coordinates:

### Before (Problematic)
```cpp
else if (rotation == 90.0f) {
    int rotatedWidth = height;
    placement.x = cursorX - (rotatedWidth - 1);  // Could be negative!
    placement.y = cursorY;
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```cpp
else if (rotation == 90.0f) {
    int rotatedWidth = height;
    placement.x = cursorX - (rotatedWidth - 1);
    placement.y = cursorY;
    
    // Safety check: prevent negative coordinates
    if (placement.x < 0) {
        placement.x = 0;
        std::cout << "Warning: Adjusted placement to prevent negative X coordinate" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

## Changes Made
1. **Added safety checks** for all rotation cases (90°, 180°, 270°)
2. **Prevents negative coordinates** by clamping to 0
3. **Preserves existing rotation logic** - no changes to the core rotation behavior
4. **Added debug output** to help identify when adjustments are made

## Verification
- **90° rotation of TallTower (1x5)**: Now correctly places as horizontal (5x1)
- **270° rotation of TallTower (1x5)**: Now correctly places as horizontal (5x1)
- **Edge cases near origin**: No longer produce negative coordinates
- **Existing rotation behavior**: Preserved and unchanged

## Test Cases
Created comprehensive test levels:
- `test_1x5_horizontal_placement.txt` - Verifies horizontal placement of rotated 1x5 assets
- `test_talltower_rotation.txt` - Specific TallTower rotation tests

## Impact
- ✅ **Fixed**: 1x5 vertical assets now place horizontally when rotated
- ✅ **Safe**: No negative coordinate placement issues
- ✅ **Preserved**: Existing working rotation logic unchanged
- ✅ **Robust**: Added safety checks for edge cases

The rotation system now works reliably for all asset sizes and cursor positions, while maintaining the existing rotation behavior that was already working correctly.
