For some reason or another, there were 28 identical frames to one of Goat Mom's sprites. I have no idea why they were there, but I removed all but one of them from this file. These are also way smaller resolution the rest of the game's sprites and don't have transparent backgrounds. Weird.

Also, why did they redesign her at all only for her to show up for less than three minutes of game time? Honestly, I wouldn't use these if you don't have to, the original game has way more variety of sprites for her.
